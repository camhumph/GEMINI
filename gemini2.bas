' CMS XT EXPORT MACRO - FIXED / SPEED + ROBUSTNESS UPDATE
' ------------------------------------------------------------
' UPDATED IN THIS VERSION:
'  1. Corrected TCP/top-side orientation axis mapping:
'       Y stack -> *Top / *Bottom
'       Z stack -> *Front / *Back
'       X stack -> *Right / *Left
'  2. Orientation now tries top/bottom HOLDER, POT, INS, then TCP/BCP.
'  3. CMS_TOP is saved from matched top-side orientation.
'  4. StabilizeActiveView restored.
'  5. DXF 1:1 setting remains forced for all DXF views/files.
'  6. Later parts include J BLOCK native-assembly DXF fix.
